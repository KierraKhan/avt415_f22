	<div class="p"><p>Mahima Karim is a West Indian who was recently invited to a Diwali Family Festival. She needed a new dress so her mother recommended to check out Moonbow. Mahima searches through the Moonbow site for a Saree dress for the event. She uses price filters low to high, searched small sizes, high positive ratings, and her favorite color for the dress. She eventually finds a dress that can be shipped to the USA just in time before the festival day. Mahima decides on a Saree that she likes, places her order in the shopping cart and pays, eagerly waiting for her dress to appear on her doorstep.</p></div>
